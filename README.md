# Tutorial
First go to infinityfree.net or 000webhostapp.com or whatever hosting site you want, then upload all of the phps and then create a databse with a username, password, database name and a server (usualy it's localhost)
Then fill it in the files and replace it with it, add your dualhook webhook and it should work! You now have a Roblox JS Logger!

Make sure to upload them in the files manager tab!


# Databse
So you need to create a databse which can be found on like infinityfree, 000webhost etc,
